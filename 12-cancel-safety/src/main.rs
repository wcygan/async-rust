/// Since a Future could be cancelled if it doesn't complete within
/// a certain amount of time, we must be careful about the notion
/// of "Cancel Safety".
/// 
/// Cancel Safety ensures that when a future is canceled, any
/// state or resources it was using are handled correctly.
/// If a task is in the middle of an operation when it's
/// canceled, it shouldn't leave the system in a bad state,
/// like holding onto locks, leaving files open,
/// or partially modifying data.
/// 
/// In Rust's async ecosystem, most operations are cancel-safe by default;
/// they can be safely interrupted without causing issues. However,
/// it's still a good practice to be aware of how your tasks interact
/// with external resources or state and ensure that those interactions
/// are cancel safe
