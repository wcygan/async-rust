# Async Rust

## Experiments

Subdirectories contain code snippets and examples inspired from the books.

### Running the examples

The directories will either contain a runnable binary, or some code that has tests associated with it. You can run the code with:

```bash
# Run a binary
cargo run
```

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Building a runnable program

```bash
cargo new --bin <id>-<project-name> --name <project-name>
```

### Building a library

```bash
cargo new --lib <id>-<project-name> --name <project-name>
```

The naming is important here because I want my examples in chronological order.
