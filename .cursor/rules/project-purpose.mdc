# Project Purpose

This project is dedicated to learning and experimenting with asynchronous programming concepts in Rust and Tokio.

The subdirectories contain various code examples and small projects related to async Rust, often inspired by learning materials like books or online resources. Refer to the main [readme.md](mdc:readme.md) for more details on the structure and running examples.

This is modeled as one rust workspace with crates for each example.
